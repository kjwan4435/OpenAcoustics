## ![example_platforms](example_platforms.png)    
 OpenAcoustics support following platforms and more. (A) Smartphones (left to right: Samsung Galaxy S24, Motorola Edge 40, and Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro), (B) Smartwatches (Samsung Galaxy Watch 7, Google Pixel Watch 3, and Xiaomi Watch Pro 2), and (C) MCUs (XIAO nRF52840 Sense and Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2)


## High-fidelity audio capture on mobile devices
Supports 48 kHz, 16-bit PCM audio recording on Android smartphones, which enables stereo recording using two microphones (e.g., top and bottom), and on smartwatches, which support mono recording with a single built-in microphone. Data transmission is performed via Wi-Fi using TCP.

## Low-power audio capture on MCUs
Enables 16 kHz, 16-bit PDM audio recording on low-cost MCUs with data transmission over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART).

Our transmission system basically uses <bluefruit.h> library which is a part of Adafruitâ€™s Bluefruit nRF52 Libraries, and it only supports Adafruit boards based on the Nordic nRF52 chipset. Thus our system supports boards which are listed below.
* Adafruit Feather nRF52832
* Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express
* Adafruit ItsyBitsy nRF52840 Express
* Adafruit Clue
* Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit
* Adafruit Metro nRF52840 Express
* Adafruit EdgeBadge
* Adafruit Bluefruit Sense

The system also supports seeed studio XIAO boards when the code uploaded through Adafruit's core and bootloader.

* XIAO nRF52840
* XIAO nRF52840 Sense

During the bluetooth communication, MCU boards does the role of peripheral device that sends data, and the computer is central device that recieves data. Arduino code and html code are both provided. You can test the BLE communication by just uploading .ino file to MCU board, and open .html file through chrome website.

In the provided .html file, there exists 5 different modes in transmission.

* IMU_ONLY : real-time streaming of IMU data only
* PDM_ONLY : real-time streaming of PDM(16 kHz, 16 bit) mic data only
* IMU_PDM Asynchronized : real-time streaming of both IMU and PDM data. IMU and PDM data is transmitted in different packets
* IMU_PDM Synchronized : real-time streaming of both IMU and PDM data. IMU and PDM data is transmitted in same packets
* Batch : buffered data transmission.

Detailed explanation of each modes will be followed.

## Multimodal sensing support
Provides optional motion data capture using built-in IMU sensors, allowing synchronized collection with audio signals. 

## Real-time transmission
Supports both real-time streaming and buffered transmission to mitigate data loss during wireless transfer.
